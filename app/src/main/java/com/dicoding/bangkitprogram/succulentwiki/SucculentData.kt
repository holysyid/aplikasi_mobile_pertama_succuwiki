As it grows tall, it begins to spill over, making “Worm Plant” a great filler for succulent arrangements. Watch for small, star-shaped flowers in the Winter.",
        "This compact, fast-growing succulent has a deceptive name. Although the green-leaved plant is known as “Ice Plant,” it is not cold hardy. It does well indoors and is great for beginners. The thick blue-green leaves stack opposite each other as they grow up the stem. It has yellow flowers that look similar to daisies that bloom in the Spring.",
        "This green succulent has teardrop shaped leaves. Each leaf is covered in fine “hairs” that offer protection from the sun. It grows on a woody stem, with leaves growing in pairs. It grows tall, making it a great addition to arrangements.",
        "This small plant has triangle-shaped leaves covered in tiny hairs. The end of the leaf forms a crinkle. It is easy to grow, making it perfect for beginners.",
        "This tall, trailing cactus is one of the most widely cultivated cacti in its genus. Its thick stems grow tall before the weight of the stems causes it to bend and either hang out of its pot, or trail along the ground. It typically produces purple-red flowers, although sometimes growers have reported pink or orange blossoms.",
        "This succulent has dark leaves, which can turn a deep purple. The leaves are bumpy and stiff, similar to a Gasteria. It propagates easily, and grows well outdoors. Watch for coral colored flowers in the Spring.",
        "This Aloe hybrid has whitish-green leaves. It forms clumps, which can easily be propagated. Its unique look adds a lot of variety to your succulent arrangements. Great for indoor growers.",
        "Haworthiopsis reinwardtii is a small clumping succulent. Its leaves are large at the bottom, then narrowing to a point as it curves upwards. The leaves spiral in a column, and have white bumps on the outside of the leaves.",
        "This bright green succulent’s long, tapered leaves are covered in translucent “teeth”. When it is happily stressed, it turns pink. It is a hybrid of Aloe nobilis and an Aloe humilis var. echinatum.",
        "“Star Cactus” is a small, slow-growing succulent with triangluar-shaped translucent leaves. The leaves bend back and create a rosette shape as they grow. \n Haworthia retusa is easily grown indoors. As it grows, it produces clumping offests. Watch for small white flowers in the Spring and Summer.",
        "This succulent is great for your indoor succulent garden. It has thick, dark green leaves with white horizontal stripes on the outside of the leaves. The inside of the leaves are smooth.",
        "This grey-green succulent has flat oval leaves with purple spots. It is a great succulent for beginners, and does well indoors with bright light. Watch for white, tube-shaped flowers in the Summer, although it rarely blooms indoors.",
        "This tiny succulent adds excellent “filler” and “spiller” in succulent arrangements. It can also be added to living succulent wreaths! ‘Tom Thumb’ grows quickly, with its bright green, triangle-shaped leaves stacking on top of each other. The edges of the leaves turn red when stressed.",
        "This miniature columnar cactus grows hundreds of green branches. As it grows, the branches clump together vertically, forming the turrets of a “fairy castle.” Each stem has five sides with short white spines growing along the ribs. It grows well indoors, and is perfect for beginners.\n Although it rarely blooms, and can take years before it is mature enough to do so, “Fairy Castle Cactus” produces white or yellow flowers."
